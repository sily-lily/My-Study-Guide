# Learning AHK Correctly 😏
Do you want to stop being a stupid idiot? Yeah, me too. That's why I spent a long time writing out these guided notes so you don't have to!

Stop reading complicated docs and start reading well formatted, well-put together docs!
- If you just stop being lazy and genuinely lock in you can learn most of the language with a little practice in like an hour. 😉

> [!NOTE]
> Spending ~**30** minutes **learning and practicing** will guarantee you learn something if you genuinely try.

> [!WARNING]
> Try not to skip any lessons! Everything is ordered from **least** to **most** skill. Skipping lessons can break your learning process, and lessons will get progressively complex.
